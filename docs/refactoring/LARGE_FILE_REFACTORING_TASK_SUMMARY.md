```
Day 1: UnitStateManager (400 lines)
Day 2: SystemComponentService (350 lines)  
Day 3: EquipmentPlacementService (450 lines)
Day 4: CriticalSlotManager (350 lines)
Day 5: WeightCalculationService (400 lines)
Day 6: ArmorAllocationService (400 lines)
Day 7: ConstructionValidatorService (450 lines)
Day 8: UnitSynchronizationService (350 lines)
```

### **Phase 2: Validation Services (Days 9-12)** 🔴 Critical  
**Target**: Split `ConstructionRulesValidator.ts` (1,800 lines → 6 validators)

### **Phase 3: Equipment Services (Days 13-15)** 🔴 Critical
**Target**: Refactor `EquipmentAllocationService.ts` (1,688 lines → 3 services)

### **Phase 4: Data Organization (Days 16-18)** 🟠 High
**Target**: Split large equipment data files into focused categories

### **Phase 5: UI Components (Days 19-22)** 🟡 Medium
**Target**: Break down large React components into smaller pieces

### **Phase 6: Utilities (Days 23-25)** 🟡 Medium
**Target**: Refactor remaining utility services

## 🛠️ **Tools & Automation Ready**

### **Quality Monitoring Commands**
```bash
# Analyze file sizes
npm run analyze:files

# Generate comprehensive report  
npm run quality:report

# Pre-commit validation
npm run refactor:pre-commit

# Full quality check
npm run quality:check
```

### **Continuous Integration**
- File size monitoring integrated
- Automated quality checks
- Regression prevention
- Metrics tracking ready

## 📊 **Expected Outcomes**

### **Quantitative Improvements**
| Metric | Current | Target | Improvement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Largest file size | 3,257 lines | 500 lines | **85% reduction** |
| Files >1000 lines | 10 files | 0 files | **100% elimination** |
| Files >500 lines | 86 files | <20 files | **75% reduction** |
| Average file size | 345 lines | ~250 lines | **30% reduction** |
| Maintainability | Low | High | **300% improvement** |

### **Qualitative Benefits**
- ✅ **Single Responsibility**: Each file has one clear purpose
- ✅ **Improved Testability**: Isolated components easier to test
- ✅ **Better Code Discovery**: Developers find code faster
- ✅ **Reduced Bug Surface**: Smaller files = fewer places for bugs
