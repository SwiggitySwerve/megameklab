1. Current Load Out (left)
2. Equipment Database (right)
3. Unallocated Equipment (top right)

### Components to Implement

#### 1. Current Load Out Panel
```typescript
interface CurrentLoadOut {
  items: Array<{
    name: string;
    tons: number;
    crits: number;
    heat: number;
    location: string;
    size: string;
  }>;
  controls: {
    remove: () => void;
    removeAll: () => void;
  };
}
```

Features:
- Table showing equipped items
- Columns: Name, Tons, Crits, Heat, Loc, Size
- Remove/Remove All buttons
- Sortable columns

#### 2. Equipment Database Panel
```typescript
interface EquipmentDatabase {
  filters: {
    categories: {
      energy: boolean;
      ballistic: boolean;
      missile: boolean;
      artillery: boolean;
      physical: boolean;
      ammo: boolean;
      other: boolean;
    };
    hideOptions: {

- Each location shows critical slots as grid
- Drag & drop equipment to slots
- Visual feedback for valid/invalid placements

### Components

#### 1. Critical Slot Grid
```typescript
interface CriticalSlotGrid {
  location: string; // Head, CT, LT, RT, LA, RA, LL, RL
  slots: Array<{
    index: number;
    content: string | null;
    isFixed: boolean; // For engine, gyro, etc.
  }>;
  maxSlots: number; // 6 for head, 12 for others
}
```

#### 2. Auto-Assignment Functions
- Auto Fill Unallocated
- Auto Compact
- Auto Sort
- Fill/Compact/Sort individual buttons
- Reset button

### Implementation Phases
1. Create critical slot visualization
