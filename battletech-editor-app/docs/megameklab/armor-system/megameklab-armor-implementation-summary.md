# MegaMekLab Armor Implementation Summary

## Completed Features (Phases 1-10)

### Phase 1: Visual Armor Diagram Component ✅
- Created interactive MechArmorDiagram component with SVG-based mech silhouette

- Visual indication of front/rear armor for torsos

### Phase 2: Icon Management System ✅
- File upload button with image preview
- Import from cache functionality (previously uploaded icons)
- Remove icon functionality
- Icons stored in localStorage
- Default mech icon display when no icon uploaded

### Phase 3: Additional Fields ✅
Added all missing fields:
- Clan Name (optional text field)

- Source/Era (text field)
- Role selection dropdown (Brawler, Sniper, Skirmisher, Scout, etc.)
- Manual BV override

### Phase 4: Omni & Configuration Support ✅
- Omni checkbox that properly updates unit configuration
- Base Type selection (Standard/Primitive)
- Motive Type selection (Biped/Quad) that affects unit config
- Proper state management for these configurations

### Phase 5: Advanced Movement Options ✅
- Jump Type dropdown (Jump Jet/UMU/Mechanical Jump Booster)
- Mechanical Jump Booster MP input (disabled unless MJB selected)
- Enhancement effects on movement:
  - MASC: Run MP = Walk MP × 2
  - TSM: +2 Walk MP when heat ≥ 9 (simulated as always active)
  - Supercharger detection and note display
- Movement validation based on engine rating

## Remaining Features (Phases 6-12)

### Phase 6: Component Weight and Availability System ✅
- Created comprehensive weight calculation functions for all components
- Implemented critical slot calculations for each component type
- Added availability codes (Format: "TechBase/Intro-Standard-Advanced-Experimental")
- Connected all dropdowns to unit data (Structure, Engine, Gyro, Cockpit, Enhancement)
- Summary panel now shows real-time calculated weights and crits
- Engine Free heat sinks calculation based on engine rating

### Phase 7: Validation and Constraints ✅
- Implemented comprehensive validation system
- Engine rating limits (≤400 standard, ≤500 XXL)
- Engine rating must be divisible by 5
- Armor points validation for each location
- Total weight validation (highlights when overweight)
- Heat sink minimum checks (10 for fusion engines)
- Critical slot availability checks
- Jump jet limitations (standard jets ≤ walk MP, MJB = 1 MP)
- Component compatibility checks (XXL + Endo Steel, Stealth + DHS, etc.)
- Warning system for suboptimal configurations
- Visual indicators in UI for validation errors

### Phase 8: Component Integration ✅
- Connected all dropdowns to unit data (Structure, Engine, Gyro, Cockpit, Enhancement)
- All selections properly update the unit data structure
- State management working correctly for all components

### Phase 9: Final Calculations ✅
- Implemented Earliest Possible Year calculation based on component introduction dates
- Equipment heat calculation from weapons and jump jets
- "Use Remaining Tonnage" button now properly calculates and allocates remaining tonnage
- All calculations update in real-time as components change

### Phase 10: Performance Optimizations ✅
- Implemented debouncing for armor value updates (150ms delay)
- Added memoization for all expensive calculations:
  - Component weight calculations
  - Critical slot calculations
  - Engine free heat sinks
  - Maximum armor calculations
  - Equipment heat generation
  - Earliest possible year
  - Unit validation
- Created comprehensive performance utilities (useDebounce, useMemoizedCalculation, etc.)
- Optimized re-renders with careful dependency tracking

## Remaining Features (Phase 11)

### Phase 11: Testing & Validation
- Unit tests for calculations
- Integration tests for workflows
- Export compatibility with MegaMekLab

## Current Status
We have successfully implemented:
1. Visual armor diagram with interactive controls
2. All UI fields matching MegaMekLab
3. Movement calculations including enhancements (MASC/TSM)
4. Component weight and critical slot calculations
5. Real-time Summary panel updates
6. Availability codes for tech level tracking
