## Implementation Plan for Remaining Work

### Phase 1: Equipment Tab Polish (1-2 hours)
1. Add tooltip component for equipment
2. Implement ammo linking logic
3. Add visual indicators for linked items

### Phase 2: Critical Slot Enhancements (2-3 hours)
1. Create auto-assignment algorithm
2. Add visual feedback for multi-slot items
3. Implement slot validation rules

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (1-2 hours)
1. Test all tab interactions
2. Verify data persistence
3. Check export functionality
4. Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Final Polish (1 hour)
1. Add loading states
2. Improve error messages
3. Enhance accessibility
4. Documentation updates

## Next Steps

The most logical progression would be:
1. Complete equipment tooltips for better user experience
2. Implement critical slot auto-assignment for easier unit building
3. Add remaining validation rules
4. Polish and test the complete system

Total estimated time to 100% completion: 5-8 hours
