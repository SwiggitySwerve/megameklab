## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Patterns
1. **Continue Dual-Mode Pattern**: Apply the same pattern used for armor to equipment and criticals
2. **Custom Hooks**: Extract logic into reusable hooks
3. **Performance**: Use virtualization for large equipment lists
4. **State Management**: Consider Redux for multi-unit state

### Integration Points
1. **Database**: Enhance equipment database structure
2. **Validation**: Create rule engine framework
3. **Export**: Extend file format support
4. **UI**: Maintain consistent design language

## Success Metrics
- Equipment placement time reduced by 50%
- Validation catches 100% of construction rule violations
- Multi-unit editing improves force building efficiency by 70%
- User satisfaction increases for power users

## Next Action Items
1. Create detailed technical design for Equipment Browser
2. Analyze MegaMekLab's equipment categorization
3. Design state structure for multi-unit editing
4. Create performance benchmarks for large equipment lists

## Conclusion
The next phase should focus on Equipment Management System as it's a core feature that users interact with constantly. This will provide immediate value and set the foundation for the critical slots enhancement. The dual-mode architecture pattern established with the armor system should be applied to maintain consistency and code reuse.
