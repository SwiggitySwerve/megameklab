# Critical Slot System - Final Analysis

## What Was Researched

The critical slot system has been thoroughly analyzed across multiple components:

1. **Core Logic** (`criticalSlotCalculations.ts`)
   - `calculateCompleteInternalStructure()` - Dynamically calculates internal structure
   - `handleSystemChange()` - Rebuilds slots when system components change
   - `rebuildCriticalSlots()` - Removes conflicting equipment

2. **Display Components**
   - `MechCriticalsAllocationGrid` - Main grid component
   - `CriticalSlotDropZone` - Individual slot component

3. **Test Pages Created**
   - `/test-integrated-critical-slots` - Shows working rebuild logic
   - `/test-critical-slot-simple` - Basic slot change demonstration
   - `/test-critical-grid-integration` - Grid with proper integration
   - `/test-slot-display` - Individual slot display test

## Core Issues Found

### 1. Display Problem
The Engine slots appear empty because:
- Grid creates equipment objects for system components
- But CriticalSlotDropZone's `renderContent()` only shows equipment name if equipment exists
- The mapping between grid data and drop zone expectations is broken

### 2. No Integration
When gyro type changes in the main UI:
- The gyro type updates in `systemComponents`
- But `handleSystemChange` is never called
- So equipment array is never rebuilt
- SRM 6 remains even when XL Gyro should occupy those slots

### 3. Data Model Mismatch
- Grid uses strings: "Engine", "Gyro", "SRM 6"
- CriticalSlotDropZone expects complex objects with specific structure
- Type mismatches between `DraggedEquipment` and `EquipmentObject`

## How It Should Work

1. **User changes gyro type** (Standard → XL)
2. **Parent calls** `handleSystemChange(unit, 'gyro', 'XL')`
3. **System calculates** new internal structure (9 slots instead of 7)
4. **Rebuild logic** detects SRM 6 conflicts with new gyro slots
5. **SRM 6 removed** and added to unallocated equipment
6. **UI updates** showing XL Gyro in slots 4-9

## What Works

- ✅ Internal structure calculation (`calculateCompleteInternalStructure`)
- ✅ Conflict detection and equipment removal (`rebuildCriticalSlots`)
- ✅ System change handling (`handleSystemChange`)
- ✅ Test pages demonstrate working logic

## What Doesn't Work

- ❌ Display of system components (Engine shows as empty)
- ❌ Integration with main UI (rebuild never called)
- ❌ Drag/drop type compatibility
- ❌ Hover states for valid drop zones

## Required Fixes

### 1. Parent Component Integration
```typescript
// In customizer or parent component
const handleGyroTypeChange = (newType: string) => {
  const { updatedUnit, removedEquipment } = handleSystemChange(unit, 'gyro', newType);
  setUnit(updatedUnit);
};
```

### 2. Fix Display Logic
The grid needs to ensure system components display their names properly.

### 3. Type Compatibility
Resolve mismatches between DraggedEquipment and EquipmentObject interfaces.

## Test Pages

All test pages are accessible from the sidebar under "Critical Slot Tests":
- **Integrated System** - Full working example
- **Simple Test** - Basic functionality
- **Debug Info** - Internal calculations
- **Rebuild Logic** - Algorithm testing
- **Grid Integration** - Grid with proper handlers
- **Slot Display Test** - Individual slot rendering

## Conclusion

The critical slot system's core logic is fully functional. The issues are entirely in the UI layer:
1. Display mapping between data and components
2. Integration between system changes and slot rebuilding
3. Type compatibility for drag and drop

The test pages prove the system works when properly integrated.
