# Critical Slot Customizer Fix Summary

## Problem
The critical slot system in the customizer UI wasn't working properly:
1. Engine slots showed as empty (displaying "1", "2", "3") instead of "Engine"
2. Changing gyro type didn't rebuild slots or remove conflicting equipment
3. The drag and drop system wasn't properly integrated with the dynamic slot rebuilding

## Root Cause
The customizer was using `CriticalsTabIntegrated` which:
- Reimplemented its own slot rebuild logic instead of using the working `handleSystemChange` function
- Used fixed slot positions (e.g., engine always in slots 0-5) instead of dynamic calculation
- Had a complex object-based data model with lots of conversion logic
- Didn't properly integrate with the system component change detection

## Solution
Created `CriticalsTabFixed` which:
1. Uses the working `handleSystemChange` function from `criticalSlotCalculations.ts`
2. Properly watches for engine/gyro type changes and rebuilds slots
3. Uses the same simple string array data model as the test page
4. Integrates with `MechCriticalsAllocationGrid` which handles the display correctly

## Files Changed
1. **Created**: `components/editor/tabs/CriticalsTabFixed.tsx`
   - Uses `handleSystemChange` for slot rebuilding
   - Watches system component changes with useEffect
   - Simple data model matching the test implementation

2. **Modified**: `components/editor/UnitEditorWithHooks.tsx`
   - Changed import from `CriticalsTabIntegrated` to `CriticalsTabFixed`
   - Updated tab configuration to use the fixed component

## How It Works Now
1. When engine or gyro type changes:
   - The component detects the change via useEffect
   - Calls `handleSystemChange` to rebuild the critical slots
   - Any conflicting equipment is removed
   - The UI updates to show the new configuration

2. The display now properly shows:
   - "Engine" in engine slots (not empty)
   - "Gyro" in gyro slots
   - Equipment names in their allocated slots
   - Slot numbers only for empty slots

## Testing
The fix can be tested by:
1. Opening the customizer (`/customizer`)
2. Going to the Structure tab
3. Changing gyro type from Standard to XL
4. Going to the Criticals tab
5. Verifying that:
   - Engine slots show "Engine"
   - XL Gyro occupies 6 slots (instead of 4)
   - Any equipment that was in the gyro's expanded slots is removed

## Key Takeaway
The test implementation was working correctly all along. The issue was that the customizer had its own parallel implementation that didn't work properly. By using the working code from the test page, the customizer now functions correctly.
