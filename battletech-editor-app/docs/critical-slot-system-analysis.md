# Critical Slot System Analysis

## Issue Summary
The critical slot system drag and drop functionality was reported as not working correctly, specifically with showing valid/invalid hover states for empty slots.

## Investigation Results

### 1. Critical Slot Logic is Working Correctly
- The CriticalsTabIntegrated component properly handles engine and gyro changes
- Engine slot allocation works correctly:
  - Standard Engine: 6 slots in Center Torso only
  - XL Engine: 6 slots in CT + 3 slots in each side torso
  - Light Engine: 6 slots in CT + 2 slots in each side torso
  - XXL Engine: 6 slots in CT + 6 slots in each side torso

### 2. Smart Displacement is Functioning
- When engine type changes, equipment in conflicting slots is properly displaced
- Multi-slot equipment is fully removed if any slot conflicts
- The `smartUpdateSlots` function correctly identifies and displaces equipment

### 3. Drag and Drop System Analysis
The drag and drop system in CriticalSlotDropZone component:
- Properly shows hover states for valid/invalid drops
- Uses CSS classes to indicate slot validity:
  - `dropZoneHover`: Basic hover state
  - `dropZoneValid`: Valid drop target (green border)
  - `dropZoneInvalid`: Invalid drop target (red border)
  - `multiSlotHighlight`: Part of multi-slot equipment preview

### 4. Actual Issue Found
The real issue discovered is not with the critical slot system itself, but with the UI controls:
- **Problem**: The select dropdown in StructureTabWithHooks doesn't trigger onChange events
- **Impact**: Users can't change engine types using the dropdown
- **Workaround**: Direct API calls to `updateEngine` work correctly

## Current State of Critical Slot System

### Working Features:
1. ✅ Drag and drop equipment to slots
2. ✅ Visual feedback for valid/invalid drops
3. ✅ Multi-slot equipment preview on hover
4. ✅ Equipment displacement when system components change
5. ✅ Proper engine slot allocation for all engine types
6. ✅ Fixed vs removable equipment distinction
7. ✅ Actuator removal/addition logic

### Known Issues:
1. ❌ Select dropdowns in StructureTabWithHooks not triggering onChange
2. ❌ This prevents users from changing engine types through the UI

## Recommended Fix
The select dropdown issue needs to be investigated. The onChange handler is properly defined but the event isn't firing when options are selected. This could be due to:
1. Event propagation issues
2. React synthetic event handling
3. CSS/styling interfering with the select element

## Test Results
- Test page with buttons instead of select: ✅ Works correctly
- Engine type changes via API: ✅ Updates critical slots properly
- Visual hover states: ✅ Display correctly for valid/invalid drops
- Multi-slot equipment handling: ✅ Proper displacement when conflicts occur

## Conclusion
The critical slot system is functioning correctly. The drag and drop hover states work as intended. The only issue is the select dropdown UI control not triggering engine type changes.
