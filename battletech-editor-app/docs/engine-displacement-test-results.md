# Engine Displacement Test Results

## Test Date: June 15, 2025

### Test Environment
- Tested in actual customizer implementation at `/customizer`
- Atlas AS7-D unit with XL Engine and Standard Gyro

### Initial State
- Engine: XL (slots 0-2 in Left/Right Torso)
- Gyro: Standard (slots 3-6 in Center Torso)
- Equipment:
  - LRM 20 in Left Torso slot 3
  - AC/10 in Right Torso slot 3
  - Medium Lasers in arms

### Code Review Findings

1. **Smart Displacement Logic (`smartUpdateSlots`)**: 
   - Correctly identifies overlapping equipment
   - Properly moves conflicting equipment to unallocated
   - Preserves equipment data with location set to empty string

2. **Engine Sync Logic (`syncEngineChange`)**:
   - Properly calls `smartUpdateSlots` before assigning new engine slots
   - Correctly updates critical allocations
   - Maintains equipment list integrity

### Actual Implementation Test Results

#### Test 1: Engine Change (XL â†’ Standard)
- **Expected**: Equipment in LT/RT slots 0-2 should be displaced to unallocated
- **Result**: Unable to complete test due to infinite render loop
- **Issue**: Maximum update depth exceeded error occurs when changing engine type

#### Infinite Loop Issue
- **Root Cause**: Auto-validation useEffect creates a render loop
- **Attempted Fix**: Added `lastValidatedUnit` tracking to prevent re-validation of same unit
- **Result**: Fix partially worked - page loads without error, but changing engine still triggers loop

### Current Status

1. **Smart Displacement Logic**: Code review confirms the logic is correctly implemented
2. **UI Blocking**: The infinite loop prevents actual testing of displacement behavior
3. **State Management**: The issue appears to be in the validation effect dependency tracking

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Disable auto-validation temporarily to test core displacement functionality
2. **Long-term**: Refactor validation to use a more stable comparison method (e.g., hash of relevant fields)
3. **Testing**: Create isolated unit tests for `smartUpdateSlots` function

### Conclusion

The smart displacement system appears to be correctly implemented based on code review. The core logic for moving equipment from conflicting slots to unallocated is in place and follows the critical slot component change rules. However, an infinite render loop issue in the auto-validation system prevents full testing in the actual UI implementation.
