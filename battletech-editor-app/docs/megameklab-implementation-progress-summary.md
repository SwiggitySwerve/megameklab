# MegaMekLab Implementation Progress Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Status: Phase 2 Complete, Phase 3 Beginning

### Completed Implementations

#### âœ… Armor Diagram System (Phases 1 & 2)
**Status**: Production-ready, awaiting integration

##### Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement
- Fixed drag functionality with proper event handling
- Implemented click-to-edit popups for manual input
- Integrated ArmorDistributionPresets with 6 tactical configurations
- Added Quick Action buttons (Maximize Armor, Use Remaining Tonnage)
- Implemented MegaMekLab-compliant allocation algorithm

##### Phase 2: Dual-Mode Architecture
- Created 4 custom hooks for logic extraction:
  - `useArmorCalculations` - Armor math and validation
  - `useArmorVisualization` - Visual state management
  - `useArmorValidation` - Real-time error checking
  - `useArmorInteractions` - Event handling
- Built unified `ArmorManagementComponent` supporting both modes
- Implemented compact mode for list views
- Created comprehensive demo pages

**Files Created**:

### Feature Completeness vs MegaMekLab

| Feature | Status | Completion |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Armor Diagram | âœ… Complete | 100% |
| Armor Allocation | âœ… Complete | 100% |
| Equipment Browser | ðŸ”§ In Progress | 40% |
| Smart Placement | ðŸ“‹ Planned | 0% |
| Critical Slots | ðŸ”§ Basic | 30% |
| Validation System | ðŸ”§ Basic | 25% |
| Multi-Unit | ðŸ“‹ Planned | 0% |
| Import/Export | âœ… Complete | 90% |

## Technical Achievements

### Architectural Patterns
1. **Dual-Mode Components**: Single component serves both read-only and edit modes
2. **Custom Hooks**: Logic extraction for reusability and testing
3. **Performance First**: Optimized rendering with memoization
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript with discriminated unions

### Code Reusability
- Armor system hooks can be adapted for equipment
- Component patterns established and documented
- Consistent UI/UX patterns across features

## Next Implementation Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Create equipment management custom hooks:
   - `useEquipmentFiltering`
   - `useEquipmentPlacement`
   - `useEquipmentValidation`
   - `useEquipmentComparison`

2. Build `EquipmentManagementComponent` following dual-mode pattern

3. Enhance equipment browser with advanced filtering

### Short Term (2-3 Weeks)
1. Implement smart placement algorithms
2. Create weapon grouping system
3. Build equipment comparison tools
4. Add batch operations

### Medium Term (1-2 Months)
1. Critical slots visual enhancement
2. Comprehensive validation system
3. Build statistics dashboard
4. Multi-unit workspace

## Integration Checklist

### Armor System Integration
- [ ] Replace StructureArmorTab content
- [ ] Add to unit detail views in compendium
- [ ] Implement in comparison views
- [ ] Update unit editor to use new component

### Equipment System Integration (Future)
- [ ] Replace current equipment tab
- [ ] Connect to critical slots
- [ ] Update validation system
- [ ] Add to unit templates

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Performance with Large Equipment Lists**
   - Mitigation: Virtual scrolling, pagination
   
2. **Complex Placement Logic**
   - Mitigation: Incremental implementation, user overrides

3. **State Management Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Consider Redux for multi-unit features

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Equipment selection time reduced by 50%
- Smart placement acceptance rate > 70%
- Zero critical bugs in production

### Developer Experience
- 90%+ test coverage
- Documentation for all components
- Consistent coding patterns

## Project Timeline

### Completed
- âœ… Weeks 1-2: Armor Diagram Phase 1
- âœ… Weeks 3-4: Armor Diagram Phase 2

### Current
- ðŸ”„ Week 5: Equipment Management Planning

### Upcoming
- Weeks 6-7: Equipment Management Implementation
- Week 8: Equipment Smart Placement
- Weeks 9-10: Critical Slots Enhancement
- Weeks 11-12: Validation System
- Weeks 13-14: Multi-Unit Features
- Weeks 15-16: Polish & Release

## Conclusion

The project has successfully established a solid foundation with the armor diagram system. The dual-mode architecture pattern has proven effective and will be applied to subsequent features. With Phase 3 (Equipment Management) planned and ready to implement, the project is on track to deliver a comprehensive MegaMekLab-style unit editor.

### Key Takeaways
1. Dual-mode pattern is highly effective for code reuse
2. Custom hooks provide excellent logic extraction
3. Comprehensive planning reduces implementation time
4. TypeScript strict mode catches issues early

### Next Action
Begin implementation of Phase 3 starting with the custom hooks for equipment management.
