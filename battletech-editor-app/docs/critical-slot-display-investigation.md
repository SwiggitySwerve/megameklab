# Critical Slot Display Investigation - Summary

## Problem
Engine slots (slots 1-3 in Center Torso) show as empty (displaying "1", "2", "3") instead of showing "Engine".

## Investigation Results

### 1. Data Flow
The data flows correctly through the system:

**Grid creates slot object:**
```javascript
{
  equipment: {
    equipmentId: 'system-Center Torso-0',
    equipmentData: {
      name: 'Engine',
      // ... other properties
    }
  }
}
```

**CriticalSlotDropZone extracts:**
```javascript
const equipment = slot.equipment?.equipmentData;  // Line 49
```

**Then displays:**
```javascript
<span className={styles.equipmentName}>
  {equipment.name}  // Line 351
</span>
```

### 2. Debug Logging Added
- Added console.log in `renderContent()` for Center Torso slots 0-2
- Added console.log in grid when creating slot objects
- Created test pages to isolate the issue

### 3. Test Pages Created
1. `/test-critical-slots` - Main test with engine/gyro selection
2. `/test-slot-rendering` - Tests three slot types
3. `/test-engine-display` - Isolates a single Engine slot

### 4. Possible Causes

1. **CSS Issue**: The equipment name might be rendered but hidden by CSS
2. **Data Not Persisting**: The slot object might be losing data between creation and render
3. **React Re-render**: Component might be re-rendering with empty data
4. **Type Mismatch**: The 'any' type casting might be causing issues

### 5. What Should Happen
1. Grid creates slot with equipment data ✓
2. CriticalSlotDropZone receives slot ✓
3. Component extracts equipment from slot.equipment.equipmentData ✓
4. Component displays equipment.name ❌

### 6. Next Steps to Debug

1. **Check Browser Console**: 
   - Look for the debug output from slots 0-2
   - Verify equipment data is present

2. **Inspect Element**:
   - Check if the equipment name is in the DOM but hidden
   - Look for CSS conflicts

3. **Add More Logging**:
   - Log in the component's useEffect to see if data changes
   - Log the full slot object in renderContent

4. **Test Direct Rendering**:
   - Try rendering equipment.name directly without the span
   - Test with inline styles to bypass CSS

### 7. System Change Integration Issue

Separately, the gyro/engine type changes don't trigger slot rebuilding because:
- The parent component doesn't call `handleSystemChange`
- Only the `systemComponents` state updates
- Critical slots remain unchanged

This needs to be fixed by integrating the rebuild logic into the parent component.
