# Critical Slot Drag & Drop Fixes Implemented

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Partial Overlap Support
**Problem**: Equipment couldn't be dragged to slots that would partially overlap with its current position.

**Solution**: Added logic in `canDrop` to detect when moving equipment within the same location:
- Calculate source range (sourceStart to sourceEnd)
- Calculate target range (slotIndex to targetEnd)
- Check if ranges overlap
- For overlapping moves, only validate non-overlapping slots are empty

```typescript
// Allow if target range overlaps with source range (partial overlap)
const overlaps = (slotIndex <= sourceEnd && targetEnd >= sourceStart);
if (overlaps) {
  // Check if all non-overlapping slots are empty
  for (let i = 0; i < item.criticalSlots; i++) {
    const checkIndex = slotIndex + i;
    // Skip slots that are part of the source equipment
    if (checkIndex >= sourceStart && checkIndex <= sourceEnd) {
      continue;
    }
    // Check if the slot exists and is empty
    if (checkIndex >= criticalSlots.length || 
        (criticalSlots[checkIndex]?.equipment !== null)) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

### 2. Red Hover Outline for Invalid Drops
**Problem**: Not showing red outline when equipment can't fit in the slots.

**Solution**: Enhanced `canDrop` validation to check:
- If there are enough slots from the hover position
- If all required consecutive slots are empty
- Returns false when conditions aren't met, triggering `invalidDrop` CSS class

```typescript
// Check if we have enough slots
if (slotIndex + item.criticalSlots > criticalSlots.length) {
  return false; // Not enough slots - will show red outline
}

// Check if all required slots are empty for multi-slot equipment
if (item.criticalSlots > 1) {
  for (let i = 0; i < item.criticalSlots; i++) {
    const checkSlot = criticalSlots[slotIndex + i];
    if (!checkSlot || checkSlot.equipment !== null) {
      return false; // Will show red outline
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Valid Drop (Green Outline)**:
   - Empty slot with enough consecutive empty slots
   - Partial overlap moves where non-overlapping slots are empty
   - Moving back to the same slot (cancel operation)

2. **Invalid Drop (Red Outline)**:
   - Not enough slots from hover position to end of location
   - Required slots are occupied
   - Disabled slots
   - Non-overlapping moves to occupied slots

3. **Partial Overlap Logic**:
   - When moving a 3-slot item from slots 5-7:
     - Can move to slots 4-6 (overlaps 5-6, needs slot 4 empty)
     - Can move to slots 6-8 (overlaps 6-7, needs slot 8 empty)
     - Can move to slots 3-5 (overlaps slot 5, needs slots 3-4 empty)
     - Cannot move if non-overlapping slots are occupied

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Single Slot Equipment**:
   - Drag over empty slot → Green outline
   - Drag over occupied slot → Red outline
   - Drop on valid slot → Success

2. **Multi-Slot Equipment (e.g., 3 slots)**:
   - Drag to slot 10 when only 2 slots remain → Red outline
   - Drag to slot where some required slots occupied → Red outline
   - Drag to valid consecutive empty slots → Green outline

3. **Partial Overlap Moves**:
   - Move 3-slot item one slot up/down → Green if adjacent slot empty
   - Move to completely different location → Standard validation

## Visual Feedback CSS Classes

- `.validDrop`: Green background (#16a34a), scaled up slightly
- `.invalidDrop`: Red background (#dc2626), cursor not-allowed
- `.hovered`: Blue background for multi-slot preview
- `.dragging`: Opacity 0.5 on source item being dragged

## Next Steps

1. Test all scenarios thoroughly
2. Add tooltips explaining why drops are invalid
3. Consider adding animation for successful drops
4. Implement undo/redo functionality
5. Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations
