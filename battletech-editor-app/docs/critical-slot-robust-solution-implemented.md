# Critical Slot System - Robust Solution Implemented

## Summary
The critical slot system has been completely rebuilt with a robust architecture that combines the working logic from test pages with the full drag & drop UI functionality.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Clean Data Separation
```typescript
// Simple arrays for equipment only (proven to work)
criticalSlots: {
  "Center Torso": ["SRM 6", null, "Heat Sink", ...]
}

// Internal structure calculated separately
internalStructure = calculateCompleteInternalStructure(unit)

// Merged only at display time
displaySlots = [...internalStructure, ...equipment]
```

### 2. Display Adapter Pattern
The component converts between the simple data model and the complex display objects only when rendering:
- Storage remains simple (string arrays)
- Display gets rich objects with metadata
- No complex state synchronization needed

### 3. System Change Handling
```typescript
// Watches for engine/gyro changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (engineChanged || gyroChanged) {
    const { updatedUnit, removedEquipment } = handleSystemChange(unit, changeType, newValue);
    setUnit(updatedUnit);
  }
}, [systemComponents?.engine?.type, systemComponents?.gyro?.type]);
```

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Proper system display**: Engine shows in slots 1-3, Gyro in 4-7 (or 4-9 for XL)
- **Dynamic rebuilding**: System changes trigger proper slot recalculation
- **Equipment displacement**: SRM 6 removed when XL Gyro expands
- **Data consistency**: Single source of truth for equipment positions

### ✅ Enhanced UI Features
- **Multi-slot hover preview**: Shows where multi-slot items will be placed
- **Clear buttons**: Per-location clear functionality
- **Drag & drop**: Full support including move between locations
- **Visual feedback**: Proper hover states and disabled states
- **Equipment panel**: Shows unallocated equipment with details

### ✅ Technical Improvements
- **Clean separation**: Internal structure never mixed with equipment
- **Index translation**: Proper conversion between display and storage indices
- **Error prevention**: Validates drops before allowing them
- **TypeScript compliance**: All type errors resolved

## Key Implementation Details

### Slot Index Translation
```typescript
// Display index → Equipment array index
const equipmentArrayIndex = slotIndex - internalSlotsCount;

// Prevents placing equipment in internal structure slots
if (equipmentArrayIndex < 0) {
  console.error('Cannot place equipment in internal structure slot');
  return;
}
```

### Multi-Slot Equipment Handling
```typescript
// Identifies consecutive slots with same equipment
for (let j = i + 1; j < slots.length && j < i + requiredSlots; j++) {
  if (slots[j].equipment?.equipmentData.name === slot.equipment.equipmentData.name) {
    consecutiveCount++;
  }
}

// Marks all slots as part of multi-slot group
if (consecutiveCount > 1) {
  for (let j = 0; j < consecutiveCount; j++) {
    slots[i + j].isPartOfMultiSlot = true;
    slots[i + j].multiSlotGroupId = groupId;
  }
}
```

## Testing the Solution

1. **Go to `/customizer`**
2. **Structure Tab**:
   - Change engine type → Verify slots rebuild
   - Change gyro to XL → Verify expands to 6 slots
3. **Criticals Tab**:
   - Verify Engine shows in Center Torso slots 1-3
   - Verify XL Gyro occupies slots 4-9
   - Verify SRM 6 was removed and appears in unallocated
   - Test drag & drop functionality
   - Test multi-slot hover preview
   - Test clear location buttons

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
2. **Reliability**: Proven data model from working test pages
3. **Performance**: No complex state synchronization
4. **Debugging**: Easy to trace data flow
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features

## Future Enhancements

1. **Validation**: Add more sophisticated placement rules
2. **Undo/Redo**: Track state changes for history
3. **Auto-allocation**: Smart placement algorithms
4. **Visual indicators**: Show weight/space constraints
5. **Context menus**: Right-click options for equipment

This solution provides a solid foundation for the critical slot system that can be extended without compromising stability.
