## üéØ **Content Placement Decision Tree**

### **Is it about project status or achievements?**
‚Üí **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md**

### **Is it about system design or architecture?**
‚Üí **TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md**

### **Is it about how to develop or work with the code?**
‚Üí **DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md**

### **Is it detailed code patterns or technical reference?**
‚Üí **IMPLEMENTATION_REFERENCE.md**

### **Is it about future enhancements or planning?**
‚Üí **FUTURE_WORK.md**

### **Is it navigation or general project info?**
‚Üí **README.md**

---

## ‚úÖ **Documentation Maintenance Rules**

### **1. Single Source of Truth**
- Each piece of information should exist in only ONE document
- If information applies to multiple areas, create cross-references instead of duplicating
- Use links between documents to connect related information

### **2. Audience-Specific Content**
- **Executives/Stakeholders**: PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md
- **Technical Architects**: TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md  
- **Active Developers**: DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md
- **Implementation Teams**: IMPLEMENTATION_REFERENCE.md
- **Product Planners**: FUTURE_WORK.md
- **All Users**: README.md for navigation

### **3. Information Hierarchy**
- **Overview level**: Brief summaries with links to details
- **Detailed level**: Complete information in appropriate specialized document
- **Reference level**: Comprehensive technical documentation

### **4. Content Updates**
- When adding new information, check if existing content needs updating
- Maintain consistency in examples and code snippets across documents
- Update cross-references when moving or changing content
- Keep README.md navigation current with any structural changes

### **5. Avoid These Patterns**
- ‚ùå Duplicating the same information in multiple documents
- ‚ùå Mixing implementation details with high-level overviews
- ‚ùå Including outdated information without clear historical context
- ‚ùå Creating new documents for topics that fit existing structure
- ‚ùå Long explanations in README.md (use it for navigation only)

## üîÑ **Content Review Process**

### **Before Adding New Content:**
1. **Identify the primary audience** for the information
2. **Check the decision tree** to determine correct document
3. **Search existing documents** to avoid duplication
4. **Consider if cross-references** are needed instead of duplication

### **When Updating Existing Content:**
1. **Verify information is current** and accurate
2. **Check for impacts** on cross-referenced content
3. **Maintain consistent** tone and format within each document
4. **Update navigation** in README.md if structure changes

### **Quality Checkpoints:**
- Does each document serve its intended audience?
- Is information easy to find using the navigation structure?
- Are there any duplicated explanations that could be consolidated?
- Do cross-references work and point to current information?

## üìä **Success Metrics for Documentation**

### **Organization Quality:**
- ‚úÖ Each document has a clear, distinct purpose
- ‚úÖ Users can find information quickly using navigation
- ‚úÖ No significant duplication between documents
- ‚úÖ Information is appropriately detailed for its audience

### **Maintenance Efficiency:**
- ‚úÖ Updates only require changes in one location
- ‚úÖ New information has an obvious placement location
- ‚úÖ Cross-references remain current and functional
- ‚úÖ Document structure supports project evolution

These guidelines ensure documentation remains organized, useful, and maintainable as the project evolves.
