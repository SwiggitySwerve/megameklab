# MegaMekLab Armor Diagram - Phases 1-3 Completion Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the completion of Phases 1-3 of the MegaMekLab armor diagram implementation, creating a comprehensive armor management system that matches the original Java implementation's functionality.

## Completed Components

### Phase 1: Enhanced Armor Type Management ✓

#### ArmorTypeSelector.tsx
- **Features Implemented:**
  - Comprehensive dropdown with 10 armor types (Standard, Ferro-Fibrous, Stealth, Hardened, etc.)
  - Tech level filtering (Introductory, Standard, Advanced, Experimental)
  - Tech base compatibility filtering (Inner Sphere, Clan, Both)
  - Detailed armor information display panel
  - Points per ton, critical slots, and tech requirements
  - Dark theme styling matching MegaMekLab

#### ArmorTonnageControl.tsx
- **Features Implemented:**
  - 0.5 ton increment validation with +/- buttons
  - Real-time armor points calculation
  - Input validation with error messages
  - Visual progress bar showing tonnage usage
  - Color-coded percentage indicators (green/blue/yellow/red)
  - Keyboard input with proper decimal handling

### Phase 2: Complete Visual Armor Diagram ✓

#### MechArmorDiagram.tsx
- **Features Implemented:**
  - Full SVG-based mech silhouette (400x500px)
  - Anatomically correct proportions for all 8 locations
  - Interactive click-to-select functionality
  - Selected location information panel
  - Color-coded legend for armor coverage levels
  - Proper max armor calculations based on mech tonnage

#### ArmorLocationVisual.tsx
- **Features Implemented:**
  - SVG-based location rendering with fill visualization
  - Drag-to-adjust armor values (vertical mouse movement)
  - Color-coded fill based on coverage percentage
  - Interactive hover states with tooltips
  - Front/rear armor split visualization for torsos
  - Location abbreviations (HD, CT, LT, RT, LA, RA, LL, RL)
  - Real-time armor value display

### Phase 3: Advanced Statistics & Validation ✓

#### ArmorStatisticsPanel.tsx
- **Features Implemented:**
  - Overall armor statistics display
  - Total armor points vs maximum possible
  - Weight efficiency (points per ton)
  - Front/rear ratio analysis for torsos
  - Per-location breakdown with visual progress bars
  - Vulnerable location warnings (<50% coverage)
  - Remaining tonnage and points calculations
  - Color-coded location status indicators

#### ArmorValidationDisplay.tsx
- **Features Implemented:**
  - Real-time validation with error/warning/info categories
  - Location-specific armor violations
  - Tech level conflict detection
  - Special armor requirements (e.g., Stealth needs Guardian ECM)
  - Construction rule validation
  - Head armor vulnerability warnings
  - Rear armor ratio warnings
  - Grouped validation messages with icons
  - Summary status indicator

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Each component manages its own local state
- Props-based communication between components
- Real-time updates without performance issues

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript implementation
- Extended ArmorType interface with all required properties
- Proper type checking for all component props

### Visual Design
- Consistent dark theme (bg-gray-800/900, border-gray-700)
- High contrast text (text-gray-100/300/400)
- Color-coded indicators:
  - Green (90%+): Excellent coverage
  - Yellow (60-89%): Good coverage
  - Orange (20-59%): Poor coverage
  - Red (<20%): Critical vulnerability

### User Experience
- Intuitive drag-to-adjust on visual diagram
- Click-to-edit on numeric controls
- Real-time validation feedback
- Comprehensive tooltips and help text
- Keyboard navigation support

## Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- Compatible with EditableUnit interface
- Uses standard FullUnit data structure
- Integrates with existing armor allocation utilities
- Works with current validation pipeline

### Data Flow
```typescript
Unit Data → Armor Components → Visual Updates → User Interaction → Data Updates
```

## Next Steps

### Phase 4: MegaMekLab Feature Parity
- ArmorDistributionPresets.tsx - Preset patterns (Striker, Brawler, Sniper)
- PatchworkArmorManager.tsx - Per-location armor types
- Advanced armor calculations (Stealth, Reactive, Hardened)

### Phase 5: Integration & Polish
- Complete StructureArmorTab.tsx implementation
- ArmorHistoryManager.tsx for undo/redo
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility improvements
- Mobile responsive design

## Known Limitations
- Patchwork armor not yet implemented
- No undo/redo functionality yet
- Distribution presets not available
- No save/load of armor configurations

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with various mech tonnages (20-100 tons)
2. Verify max armor calculations
3. Test drag functionality across browsers
4. Validate tech level restrictions
5. Check special armor requirements

## Conclusion
Phases 1-3 have successfully created a functional armor management system with:
- Complete visual representation
- Interactive controls
- Real-time validation
- Comprehensive statistics
- MegaMekLab-matching dark theme

The foundation is solid for implementing the remaining advanced features in Phases 4-5.
