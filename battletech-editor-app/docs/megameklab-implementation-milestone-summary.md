## 🎯 Original Roadmap Progress

### **Phase 1-3: ✅ COMPLETE**
- ✅ Core Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ Basic Armor Location Control  
- ✅ Armor Statistics Panel
- ✅ Equipment List Components
- ✅ Mech Armor Diagram Layout
- ✅ Critical Slots Diagram
- ✅ React DnD Setup
- ✅ Draggable Equipment

- 🔲 Fluff editor (rich text)
- 🔲 Quirks manager (checkbox grid)
- 🔲 Save/Load system (MegaMekLab format)

## 🚀 Next Implementation Priorities

### **Immediate Next Steps (Week 1-2):**

#### 1. **Auto-Allocation System**
```typescript
// utils/armorAutoAllocation.ts
export const autoAllocateArmor = (
  unit: EditableUnit,
  totalPoints: number
): ArmorAllocation[] => {
  // Head gets 5x internal structure (max 9/12)
  // Torsos: 75% front, 25% rear  
  // Distribute by internal structure ratios
}
```

#### 2. **Equipment Auto-Fill**
```typescript
// utils/criticalAutoAllocation.ts
export const autoFillCriticals = (
  unit: EditableUnit
): CriticalAllocation[] => {
  // Prioritize unhittable equipment in head/center torso
  // Spread equipment like Endo Steel across locations
  // Balance weight distribution
}
```

#### 3. **Enhanced Drag & Drop**
- Implement actual equipment placement in critical slots
- Add multi-slot equipment handling
- Validate placement rules (can't place in internal structure)
- Add equipment removal functionality

### **Medium-term Goals (Month 1):**

#### 4. **Fluff Editor Implementation**
```typescript
// components/editor/tabs/FluffTab.tsx
- Rich text editor with markdown support
- Image upload and management  
- Unit history and background
- System components table
```

#### 5. **Quirks Management System**
```typescript
// components/editor/tabs/QuirksTab.tsx
- Responsive checkbox grid for quirks
- Positive/Negative quirk categories
- Validation for disallowed combinations
- Per-weapon quirk support
```

#### 6. **Import/Export System**
```typescript
// utils/unitExportImport.ts
- Export to MegaMekLab .mtf format
- Import existing unit files
- Local storage for draft units
- Unit validation on import/export
```
