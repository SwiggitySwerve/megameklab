## üìÅ **Files in this Folder**

### **[remaining_limitations_analysis.md](./remaining_limitations_analysis.md)**
**Priority**: Medium to Low  
**Description**: Detailed analysis of remaining limitations and potential improvements
**Key Items**:
- UI component updates for new filter types
- Equipment tech base population improvements
- Advanced validation rules
- Era-based technology progression
- Template generation features

**Estimated Effort**: 8-15 hours total across multiple phases

### **[ui_design_enhancements.md](./ui_design_enhancements.md)**
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: User interface and experience improvements
**Key Items**:
- Enhanced filtering UI components
- Visual indicators for tech base and validation status
- Improved user experience workflows
- Modern design system implementation

**Estimated Effort**: 4-8 hours for UI/UX improvements

---

## üöÄ **Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)**

### **1. Equipment Tech Base Population** (1-2 hours)
- Update `populate_db.py` to derive tech_base from equipment naming patterns
- Improves mixed tech validation accuracy
- **Impact**: Better validation for mixed tech units

### **2. Role Enumeration in Schema** (30 minutes)
- Add role enum to JSON schemas instead of loose string
- Improves type safety and validation
- **Impact**: Better data validation and API consistency

### **3. Filter UI Component Updates** (2-3 hours)
- Update React components to use new enum types
- Add OmniMech and configuration filtering
- **Impact**: Users can access new filtering capabilities

---

## üìà **Future Enhancement Phases**

### **Phase 1: UI Polish** (4-6 hours)
- Implement enhanced filter components
- Add validation status indicators
- Add tech base visual badges
- Improve user experience workflows

### **Phase 2: Advanced Features** (6-8 hours)
- Template generation system
- Advanced validation rules
- Era-based technology restrictions
- Performance optimizations

### **Phase 3: Extended Compatibility** (8-12 hours)
- Support for additional unit types (IndustrialMechs, Superheavy)
- Faction-specific restrictions
- Battle Value calculations
- Export compatibility with MegaMekLab formats

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not Production Blockers**

**Important**: None of these items are required for production deployment. The current implementation is:
- ‚úÖ **Fully functional** with 100% test coverage
- ‚úÖ **Production ready** with sub-1-second performance
- ‚úÖ **Complete MegaMekLab parity** for core functionality
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive validation** for all supported features

These TODO items represent **enhancements** and **optimizations** that could improve the user experience and extend functionality beyond the core requirements.

---

## üìû **Implementation Notes**

### **Before Starting Any TODO Work**
1. **Verify current system stability** - Run full test suite
2. **Document current baseline** - Record current performance metrics
3. **Create feature branches** - Use Git branches for experimental work
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** - Don't break existing functionality

### **Priority Guidelines**
- **High**: Items that improve user experience with existing features
- **Medium**: Items that add new functionality users might expect
- **Low**: Items that are "nice to have" but not commonly requested

### **Testing Requirements**
- All new features must include comprehensive tests
- Performance impact must be measured and documented
- UI changes should include visual regression testing
- Backward compatibility must be maintained
