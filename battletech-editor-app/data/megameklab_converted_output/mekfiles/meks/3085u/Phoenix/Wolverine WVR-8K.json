    "overview": "The Wolverine commonly served as a heavy scout unit. Often deployed in situations where heavy opposition could easily destroy lighter BattleMechs, it has had a reliable service record ever since its initial deployment within the Star League Defense Force. With respectable armor, speed, and firepower, it can easily outfight lighter enemy scouts and defend itself capably if ambushed.",
    "capabilities": "The autocannon, missile system and laser found on most Wolverines are all reliable and well-storied systems. Unfortunately, the jump jets suffer from an opposing reputation; the Northrup 12000's are underpowered and prone to breakdowns. The one defining system to be found on the Wolverine, however, are its superb Tek BattleCom and Garret T11-b communications systems. The comgear, regardless of the manufacturer, is well-shielded and features a multi-channel transmitter and receiver, making the Wolverine a powerful Command BattleMech for scouting formations.",
    "deployment": "The 8K Wolverine was first introduced for the Combine in 3064 when Victory Industries decided to update the design. It is built using an XL engine for power and uses fifteen double heat sinks for its high heat load. This variant carries, as its main weapon, a Lords Light ER PPC in the right arm backed up by an Diverse Optics ER medium laser also in the right arm and a Victory Heartbeat medium pulse laser in the head. Finally, to exploit any weak points in an enemy's armor, the 'Mech carries a Guided Technologies Second Gen Streak SRM-6 launcher in the left torso along with one ton of ammo. Twelve tons of Starshield A armor with CASE provide additional protection, with the plating designed specifically to make repairs quicker to accomplish. Although certain prestigious Combine units turned their noses up at using a refurbished 'Mech to replenish their ranks, many others were less picky and the design proliferated after its success on Al Na'ir.",
    "history": "A widespread part of every major military, the Wolverine has manufacturing plants scattered throughout the entire Inner Sphere. While certain states-notably the Free Worlds League-have larger numbers of the design, only the Capellans began facing a shortage of the Wolverine after the loss of their Nanking facilities."
