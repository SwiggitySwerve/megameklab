    "overview": "The Timber Wolf is a fast, heavy OmniMech. A signature design of the Clans' military might, it was arguably the first Clan OmniMech encountered by Inner Sphere forces (as opposed to periphery forces) on The Rock in 3049 by Phelan Kell. The Timber Wolf is vastly more powerful than either the Marauder or the Catapult. It uses its speed and firepower to engage an enemy at the range of its choosing. When first encountered by Inner Sphere forces the idea that a heavy 'Mech could move so swiftly while being as heavily armed and armored as the Timber Wolf was inconceivable. With its twelve tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor and arsenal that rivaled that of most assault 'Mechs of the era, it was completely alien to Inner Sphere military planners, commanders, and even the Precentor Martial of ComStar. Its technological secrets have since been reverse-engineered by the Inner Sphere.",
    "capabilities": "A non-standard alternate configuration of the Timber Wolf, this configuration was famously used by Star Colonel Aidan Pryde. The primary long range weapons are a pair of ER Large Lasers which are backed up by a pair of LRM-20s for long range combat. For close combat, two ER Medium Lasers are carried as well as an ER Small Laser. The Pryde Configuration also mounts four jump jets making it highly maneuverable.",
    "deployment": "Commanding the rebuilt Falcon Guards of the Jade Falconâs Gamma Galaxy. Aidan Pryde's command gave the Falcons best showing. When the Com Guards forced them to retreat from Olalla, Aidan stood alone against the pursuers so that his fellow Falcons could escape. Alone, he destroyed more than a dozen Comguard âMeks before he was killed.",
    "history": "Vaguely resembling a cross-over between the MAD (Marauder) and CAT (Catapult) series, the Timber Wolf was tagged with the Inner Sphere reporting name Mad Cat on first contact. (The targeting computer on Phelan Kell's Wolfhound switched between MAD and CAT when trying to identify it; upon analyzing the data recording from Kell's 'Mech, Precentor Martial Anastasius Focht later officially designated it \"Mad Cat\".\nmanufacturer:Wolf Clan Site #1, Wolf Clan Site #2, W-7 Facilities, Kallon Weapon Industries\nprimaryfactory:Arc-Royal, Strana Mechty, Weingarten, Thermopolis\nsystemmanufacturer:CHASSIS:Type W3 Endo-steel\nsystemmanufacturer:ENGINE:Starfire 375 XL\nsystemmanufacturer:ARMOR:Composite A-2 Ferro-Fibrous\nsystemmanufacturer:COMMUNICATIONS:Khan Series (Type 2c)\nsystemmanufacturer:TARGETING:Series III OPT"
