    "overview": "The Wolfhound IIC is the rebuilt version of \"Grinner\", Phelan Kell's Wolfhound BattleMech.",
    "capabilities": "It uses an endo steel internal structure and an XL engine to save weight, while also mounting six and a half tons of ferro-fibrous armor, the most that can be squeezed onto the chassis. An ECM suite provides additional defense against enemy electronics.",
    "deployment": "The IIC variant of the Wolfhound is a straight improvement to the Wolfhound, with improved range, damage, and heat control. The arm-mounted Series 7K ER big laser is its most powerful and longest-range weapon, complemented by a trio of torso-mounted Kolibri Omega Series medium pulse lasers that deliver precision firepower, and a rear-mounted Series 2b ER medium laser that scares any 'Mech that gets behind it. As long as the rear-mounted laser is not used, the utilization of 14 double heat sinks is sufficient to keep heat levels to a minimum.",
    "history": "The design team tasked with rebuilding Grinner was initially set on using some of the weight savings of Clan technology to mount an anti-missile system in the design, but the technicians eventually decided that it would go against the Wolfhound's design specification as an all-energy weapon platform with no ammunition concerns. It is unknown whether this design was ever fully realized, and the only variant known to exist is his.\nmanufacturer:Refit\nprimaryfactory:Various\nsystemmanufacturer:CHASSIS:Unknown\nsystemmanufacturer:ENGINE:Unknown\nsystemmanufacturer:ARMOR:Unknown\nsystemmanufacturer:JUMPJET:Unknown\nsystemmanufacturer:COMMUNICATIONS:Unknown with ECM\nsystemmanufacturer:TARGETING:Unknown"
