    "overview": "Originally developed in the final year of the Amaris Civil War as the ultimate fixed position city defense BattleMech.",
    "capabilities": "The Annihilator is armed with an arsenal that is built to instill fear in an enemy as much as damage them. The 100-ton 'Mech has a maximum speed of 32.4 km/h, making it one of the slowest 'Mechs ever designed together with the UrbanMech. It is by no means intended to use speed to outmaneuver an enemy, instead depending on its twelve and a half tons of armor to weather any fire that is directed at the 'Mech.",
    "deployment": "Apparently based on the ANH-1G, this variant only uses Clan technology. The 'Mech's top speed was 32.4 km/h and the armor protection was reduced, but four Gauss Rifles backed up by an ER PPC in the center torso and a head mounted ER Small Laser provided withering firepower for defensive engagements. Ten tons of ammunition kept the Gauss Rifles fed through the longest engagements. To make room for all these weapons, the C2 used an Endo Steel internal structure. Integrated CASE protected the arms and torsos from Gauss Rifle explosions.",
    "history": "The Annihilator was built as a sign of the military strength of both the Star League in Exile and the newly created Clans. Discontinued before the Clans' Golden Century, in one of their few missteps, the Wolf's Dragoons brought a number of unknown designs with them in 3009, raising more questions to their origins while at the same time adding to their mystique. It was exclusive to the Dragoons until the Jihad disseminated the design to Arc-Royal due to the strengthening of the relationship that Wolf's Dragoons forged with the Kell Hounds and Clan Wolf-in-Exile following their flight from Outreach."
