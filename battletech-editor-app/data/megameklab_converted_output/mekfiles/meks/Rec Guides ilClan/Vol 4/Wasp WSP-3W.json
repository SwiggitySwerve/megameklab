    "overview": "Introduced in 2464 as an attempt by General Mechanics to create a fast and maneuverable recon BattleMech for the Terran Hegemony, the Wasp was revolutionary for being the first 'Mech capable of jumping, sporting a prototype Jump Jet system; however, the system was not perfected for most of the next decade. With improvements in production and Jump Jet technology, the modern WSP-1A Wasp began production in 2471. Centuries later, it is still considered a valued asset for recon work and is one of the most numerous 'Mechs in existence.",
    "capabilities": "The WSP-1A Wasp was not designed as a line combat unit. It carries a light weapons payload meant primarily for self-defense against other Light 'Mechs and was not meant to be used to engage heavier 'Mechs, resulting in tactics such as the Jump-Kick in order to deal more damage. The six Jump Jets split between the Wasp's left and right leg are responsible for its jumping distance of 180 meters and its longevity as a recon 'Mech. It also makes up for the relatively slow 66.5 km/h cruising speed produced by its four-ton fusion engine. Ten standard heat sinks are more than enough for the Wasp - it can actually fire both of its weapon systems continuously with little to no issue unless the jump jets have been overused. The three tons of armor protection is average for light 'Mechs, and with its placement around the chassis essentially two shots to the same spot anywhere will punch through and cause damage.",
    "deployment": "Manufactured by Achernar for Wolf's Dragoons in 3050, the Clan Invasion era 3W upgraded the armor to Ferro-Fibrous and carried two Sutel Precision Line Small Pulse Lasers in the right arm and four ChisComp 32 small lasers split between left leg and left torso. This increased firepower came at the cost of reducing armor protection to just two tons.",
    "history": "The classic WSP-1A had a ground speed that could be considered lackluster when compared to many modern light 'Mechs, but this was offset by its jump capability. While carrying heavier weapons than 'Mechs like the Locust, the Wasp would generally only engage other light 'Mechs, using its jump capabilities to avoid conflicts with larger foes. The Wasp was also used in the role of raider because of its ability to hit and fade in rough terrain. Even after the sheer destruction of the Succession Wars, the Wasp still remained the most numerous 'Mech ahead of the Locust and Stinger; many thousands were in use by all of the Great Houses and in the Periphery while a hundred more were built each year from factories across known space. Nearly half of all newly-built Wasps came from IBMU's and Kali Yama's factories located in the Free Worlds League on Shiro III and Kalidasa respectively. Among other major Inner Sphere Wasp manufacturing sites were Defiance Industries' Furillo factory within the Lyran Commonwealth and Archenar BattleMechs on New Avalon within the Federated Suns. Many of the Great Houses had Wasp variants built specifically for them, as did Wolf's Dragoons. Out in the Periphery the Wasp was manufactured on Taurus, Perdition, Canopus IV and Alpheratz, making it equally common among the Periphery States. The reintroduction of Star League lostech was used to update the ancient design with modern improvements, starting first with the WSP-1S built by Defiance for the Federated Commonwealth. This was followed by the new WSP-3W built specifically for Wolf's Dragoons by Archenar, then the WSP-3M built by IBMU and Kali Yama. Another wave of updates came when Vicore Industries began to peddle their \"Project Phoenix\" program and found a willing buyer in Hellespont Industries. Requiring only minor changes to their production line, these new more mobile, more stealthy WSP-3Ls debuted in late July of 3067, and within the Capellan Confederation Armed Forces was used with new Raven and Phoenix Hawk models to form Shadow Lances. Taurus Territorial and Detroit Consolidated also began building these new Wasps under license from Hellespont, while Defiance designed their own updated version of the Wasp, the WSP-3S, which was then licensed to Archenar."
