    "overview": "The Mastodon is an Assault OmniMech originally built by the Rasalhague Dominion and its Clan Ghost Bear brethren",
    "capabilities": "A veritable juggernaut of a 'Mech, JÃ¶tunn BattleWorx made use of technologies unusual in a Clan design in order to protect the Mastodon. Namely, a reinforced skeleton is employed, making it highly durable though arduous to maintain. This protection is further bolstered by the use of fifteen and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous Armour which also serves to save weight, allowing it a generous 45 tons of pod space for equipment. Propelling the design is an XL 285 fusion engine which affords it a pace of 54 km/h, sufficient for its role.",
    "deployment": "Equipped with long-range weaponry, this configuration's primary armament is a Gauss rifle carried in the right arm and fed by 2 tons of ammo. Additionally, it carries an LRM-15 linked to an Artemis IV fire control system in the right torso, calling upon 2 tons of CASE IIâprotected ammo stored with it. These are all backed up by 3 large pulse lasers in the left arm. To offset the added heat from this weapons load, it carries 5 extra double heat sinks.",
    "history": "Spurred by the Clan Hell's Horses invasion of 3147, this unusually ponderous design marks a shift in the Dominion's preferred combat doctrine, previously focused around swift, agile attackers. Equipped with ample weaponry and advanced protective technologies previously unfamiliar to the Clans, the result is a powerful, resilient OmniMech capable of filling both defensive and heavy assault roles, and able to weather whatever its enemy could possibly throw at it. In fact, the Mastodon's exceptional durability is often utilised by its pilots in order to fool foes into overcommitting, by pretending to have taken more damage than they actually have. Directly related to the company's earlier Rime Otter rework of Bergan Industries' Grizzly, JÃ¶tunn made use of reused and scaled-up components and technologies from these earlier programs throughout the development process, in order to reduce costs and streamline development."
