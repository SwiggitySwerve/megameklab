    "overview": "The Mastodon is an Assault OmniMech originally built by the Rasalhague Dominion and its Clan Ghost Bear brethren",
    "capabilities": "A veritable juggernaut of a 'Mech, JÃ¶tunn BattleWorx made use of technologies unusual in a Clan design in order to protect the Mastodon. Namely, a reinforced skeleton is employed, making it highly durable though arduous to maintain. This protection is further bolstered by the use of fifteen and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous Armour which also serves to save weight, allowing it a generous 45 tons of pod space for equipment. Propelling the design is an XL 285 fusion engine which affords it a pace of 54 km/h, sufficient for its role.",
    "deployment": "The design's Prime Configuration is geared towards long range firepower, which comes in the form of a powerful ER PPC in each arm as well as a pair of Streak LRM-20s, one mounted in each side torso. These weapons are supplied by four tons of CASE II-protected ammunition, distributed evenly between the side torsos. Nineteen double heat sinks ensure the 'Mech runs cool, even after a full alpha strike.",
    "history": "Spurred by the Clan Hell's Horses invasion of 3147, this unusually ponderous design marks a shift in the Dominion's preferred combat doctrine, previously focused around swift, agile attackers. Equipped with ample weaponry and advanced protective technologies previously unfamiliar to the Clans, the result is a powerful, resilient OmniMech capable of filling both defensive and heavy assault roles, and able to weather whatever its enemy could possibly throw at it. In fact, the Mastodon's exceptional durability is often utilised by its pilots in order to fool foes into overcommitting, by pretending to have taken more damage than they actually have. Directly related to the company's earlier Rime Otter rework of Bergan Industries' Grizzly, JÃ¶tunn made use of reused and scaled-up components and technologies from these earlier programs throughout the development process, in order to reduce costs and streamline development."
