    "overview": "The Nova is a versatile medium OmniMech that is capable of acting as a workhorse design in most forces. In fact, the design is so well balanced that it inspired the creation of the Black Hawk-KU, an Inner Sphere design based on the Nova and named using the Inner Sphere code name for this 'Mech: Black Hawk.",
    "capabilities": "Equipped with a 250 XL Model SF-2 Fusion Engine, the Nova has a ground speed of 86.4 km/h that allows it to keep up with most heavy and assault 'Mechs while being outpaced by most lighter 'Mechs. However, the Nova remains very maneuverable through the use of five jump jets, allowing the Nova to jump up to 150 meters. The fourteen double heat sinks that the Nova mounts are barely sufficient to handle its heavy heat load of its variants. The Nova is also protected by ten tons of armor, providing the 'Mech with ninety-six percent of its maximum armor protection.",
    "deployment": "This configuration carries a ProtoMech AC/8 with two tons of ammo in the right arm. An Improved Heavy Medium Laser is installed in each side torso, and seven ER Small Lasers are in the left arm. All these weapons are tied into a Targeting Computer.",
    "history": "The Black Hawk's debut battle was the combined assault on Kindraa Smythe-Jewel on Foster in 2872 launched by the Hell's Horses, Clan Coyote and Kindraa Payne that saw the Smythe-Jewels wiped out as a faction. However, the number of Novas has been diminishing. Only spare parts have been in production since 2921. Designed as an early OmniMech by Clan Hell's Horses, the Nova was produced at the famous Tokasha Mechworks beginning in 2870. At the time of its introduction, the Nova was designed for infantry support, and was the first OmniMech designed with hardpoints allowing Elementals to easily mount and dismount the chassis. However, after Tokasha was taken by Clan Ghost Bear during the Battle of Tokasha, production of the Nova ceased. Since 2921, every Clan has acquired Nova OmniMechs as isorla. Although the last Nova factory was replaced to create Pouncers, the very few remaining in Clan Space have gotten into the hands of Aggressor Mechwarriors."
