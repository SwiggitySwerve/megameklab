    "overview": "The Hierofalcon is a Medium Clan OmniMech designed primarily as a striker type design by Clan Jade Falcon. Developed by the Falcons in the mid-3140s as part of the Clan's increasing emphases on maneuverability and fast movement.",
    "capabilities": "As part of the push to be ever more flexible in movement, the 'Mech features a 270 Rated Extra-Light Engine. The addition of a permanently equipped Partial Wing adds to its maneuverability and cooling abilities. The 'Mech's hull is protected by 7.5 tons of Ferro-Fibrous Armor, giving it modest protection from enemy fire, while an ECM Suite provides additional protection from other threats. The Mech was constructed to handle 19 tons of OmniPods for weapons and equipment.",
    "deployment": "The D, unlike earlier configurations, lacks JumpJets, but features a Supercharger for added mobility. This configuration is mostly a laser-based Striker model, with a pair of ER & Pulse Lasers in each of its arms. For added all-range firepower, it features two Six Tubed Advanced Tactical Missile Launchers in each of its side torsos with the ammunition protected by CASE II.",
    "history": "Developed by the Falcons in the mid-3140s as part of the Clan's increasing emphases on maneuverability and fast movement, the 'Mech began construction in 3148 on Alyina's CJF Factory Zone 4, The Hierofalcon was designed at the same time as the larger Jade Phoenix. The duo were part of a new generation of OmniMechs intended to eventually replace the Standard BattleMechs used by the Clan. One of its noted early actions was in 3149, in a skirmish against the Falcons' former close allies, Clan Hell's Horses on Hyperion. The light and swift Hieronfalcons overwhelmed the Horses' Nova, gaining a reputation among the Horses as being a terror on the battlefield."
