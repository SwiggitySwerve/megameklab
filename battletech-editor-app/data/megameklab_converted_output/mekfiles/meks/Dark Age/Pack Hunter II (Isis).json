    "overview": "The Pack Hunter II is a light BattleMech produced by Clan Wolf-in-Exile on Arc-Royal during the Jihad.",
    "capabilities": "The 'Mech's legs are protected from possible Battle Armor attack by having a B-Pod mounted in each leg. The 'Mech's weapons and movement heat is managed by 10 Double Heat Sinks, but it's not adequate enough to handle the 'Mech's heat load.",
    "deployment": "The personal Mech of Galaxy Commander Isis Bekker of Clan Ghost Bear's Omega Galaxy in 3136, this Pack Hunter II variant removes the standard weaponry of the Pack Hunter II. In its place, the 'Mech carried a Medium Pulse Laser in each arm, twin ER Micro Lasers in the right and left torso. To provide additional punch, an Artemis IV enhanced SRM-6 was mounted in the right torso. This version also carries slightly less armor than a standard Pack Hunter II.",
    "history": "The 'Mech would first appear in combat in 3077 after a considerable amount of delays in its development. The design was originally seen as the OmniMech successor to the original Pack Hunter, however the Blakist attack against Arc-Royal and other priorities caused the delays. The Pack Hunter II improves on its predecessor's qualities. Among the things the 'Mech has been fitted with, the designers made a substantial improvement in armor and weaponry while retaining the original's speed. In a bid to improve survival rates of pilots, the design also includes a Full-Head Ejection System to prevent the loss of a warrior in combat. The design had been seen deployed by 3085 with toumans of Clan Hell's Horses, the Draconis Combine and the Republic of the Sphere\nmanufacturer:WC Site 3\nprimaryfactory:Arc-Royal\nsystemmanufacturer:CHASSIS:Type AR1 Endo Steel\nsystemmanufacturer:ENGINE:Light Force (ExtraLight) 210\nsystemmanufacturer:ARMOR:Royal-7a Ferro-Fibrous\nsystemmanufacturer:JUMPJET:Leaper Model, L5\nsystemmanufacturer:COMMUNICATIONS:Trueborn Ultra 945B\nsystemmanufacturer:TARGETING:Hunter 5 Dedicated TTS"
