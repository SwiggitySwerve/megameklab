    "overview": "The SLDF's original design specifications for the Cestus, a medium fire-support BattleMech, asked for two PPCs, two big lasers, and a pair of medium pulse lasers.",
    "capabilities": "The new generation of Cestus BattleMechs produced in the last decade is powered by GM's efficient 260 XL engine, with a top speed of 64 kphâa rating that many perceive to be on the slow side for a 'Mech at the light end of the heavy spectrum. The Cestus' weaponry, on the other hand, makes it a lethal foe at any range. The huge torso-mounted Gauss gun can provide catastrophic damage at long range. The Gauss rifle is supported by large and medium lasers installed in each arm. The Cestus retains both of its hand actuators for close-range fighting, capable of gripping or striking an opponent as needed.",
    "deployment": "The 6Z variant of the Cestus is a throwback to the original concept of the 'Mech. The 6Z variant is armed with two PPCs in place of the Gauss rifle. The saved weight is used to add four more double heat sinks to the 'Mech, helping to alleviate the large amounts of excess heat from the twin PPCs. This variant of the Cestus does sacrifice the cool-running aspect of the design for increased firepower but also has the added benefit of being able to operate for long periods of time without needing to resupply.",
    "history": "The CTS-6Y Cestus began production for the Star League Defense Force in 2766. However the original CTS-6X Cestus was produced during 2603. Introduced by General Motors and constructed at their Kathil plant, the Cestus served in the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns after the Fall of the Star League until its factory became a casualty during a Capellan Confederation Armed Forces raid at the beginning of the Second Succession War. The 'Mech was originally designed to carry a heavy energy weapons payload, but because of complications encountered with the heat sinks on the 'Mech, the upgraded Cestus was modified to carry a mix of ballistic and energy weapons. The Cestus was reintroduced by both Blue Shot Weapons and General Motors in the mid-3050s."
