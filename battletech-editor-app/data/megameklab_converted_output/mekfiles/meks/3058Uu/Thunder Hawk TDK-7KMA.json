    "overview": "The Thunder Hawk, developed by Norse Technologies for the Amaris-Terran Hegemony invasion, became a staple in General Aleksandr Kerensky's forces. Surviving 'Mechs were taken into Exodus, symbolizing their significance. In the 3050s, Norse-Storm BattleMechs revived the Thunder Hawk among other Star League-era designs.",
    "capabilities": "Dominating the Thunder Hawk's arsenal are three Norse Gauss rifles, accounting for over half its weight. These long-range weapons can incapacitate most foes with a single barrage. Ammunition is distributed throughout the torso to mitigate critical damage risks. However, its Achilles' heel lies in the extra-light Vlar fusion engine. While heavily armored, any breach in the torso significantly compromises the BattleMechâs structural integrity, rendering it inoperable.",
    "deployment": "The Thunder Hawk TDK-7KMA variant stands as a popular choice among commanders for its artillery capabilities, making it the preferred personal 'Mech in many scenarios. This variant is designed to provide artillery support to a company or battalion, hence its classification as a \"Missile Boat.\"<p>In the TDK-7KMA, one of the powerful Gauss Rifles, specifically the one in the left torso, has been replaced by an Arrow IV missile system. This change significantly enhances the Thunder Hawk's long-range bombardment capabilities. The ammunition for the Gauss Rifles is now relocated to the left leg, where two tons of missile munitions are stored, ensuring ample supply for sustained artillery operations.</p><p>This variant retains the three Medium Lasers in the right and left arms and one in the head, providing it with reliable short to medium-range defense capabilities. The remaining two Gauss Rifles, one in the right arm and one in the right torso, continue to offer formidable long-range striking power.</p><p>Powered by a 300 XL Engine, the TDK-7KMA maintains a top speed of 32.4 km/h, consistent with other Thunder Hawk models. The use of double heat sinks aids in managing the heat generated by its weapons systems, particularly the Arrow IV missile system.</p><p>However, like its predecessors, the TDK-7KMA faces challenges in maintenance due to its complex systems. As a command 'Mech with a good reputation, it serves as a versatile tool on the battlefield, capable of fulfilling both direct fire and artillery roles, making it a valuable asset for commanders seeking a blend of firepower and strategic flexibility.</p>",
    "history": "The Thunder Hawk became a hallmark of the Lyran Alliance, extensively utilized during the FedCom Civil War. Contrary to its design as a support 'Mech, Loyalists deployed it in direct combat, leveraging its heavy armor. Post-war, Archon Peter Steiner Davion allocated new Thunder Hawks to units loyal to Allied forces. Plans for export are pending until the completion of military restructuring."
