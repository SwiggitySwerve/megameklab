    "capabilities": "Though not taken to the same extreme as other Clan Totem 'Mechs, the Kodiak does epitomize the Ghost Bears' method of warfare, combining an impressive defensive platform with surprising amounts of speed and firepower. Its massive 400-rated XL Engine propels the Kodiak to a maximum speed of 64.8 km/h, while seventeen and a half tons of Compound 12A2 gives it impressive armor protection. Though it mounts an incredible amount of firepower, even the use of twenty double heat sinks cannot prevent overheating problems when they are all fired simultaneously, though most MechWarriors learn to use their weapons sparingly and love the 'Mech's ability to deliver a massive knockout punch. The Kodiak incorporates the Garret L20 as its communications system, and uses the RCA Instatrac Mark IX for targeting, however the \"claws\" mounted on both of its arms are purely aesthetic.",
    "deployment": "This variant created by Clan Snow Raven in the mid-3060s turns the Kodiak into an anti-aircraft platform. Removing all but four of the arm-mounted medium lasers and reducing the number of heat sinks to fourteen freed up room for a pair of LB-X Autocannon/20s, three tons of ammo each, and an advanced targeting computer.",
    "history": "The vast majority of Kodiaks are used by the Ghost Bears, and indeed was exclusive to them in the first years since its introduction. Of those which are found in other toumans, Clan Snow Raven has the largest share, payment for their help in relocating to the Inner Sphere, followed by Clan Goliath Scorpion and Clan Cloud Cobra. Among the Crusader Clans though, only Clan Ice Hellion fields a handful of these 'Mechs. As a interesting note, and proof of the expansion of the Kodiak, at least two of these mechs were found in a Smoke Jaguar unit on planet Asgard, during Operation Bulldog."
