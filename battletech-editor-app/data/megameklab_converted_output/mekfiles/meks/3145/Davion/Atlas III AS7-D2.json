    "overview": "A Dark Age-era evolution of the original Atlas, featuring a mix between advanced Clan and Inner Sphere technologies. The Atlas III is usually used as a Command 'Mech among the ranks of the AFFS and the Republic of the Sphere Armed Forces.",
    "capabilities": "The D3's construction reflects its intended role as (almost) a custom design for Commanders. The 'Mech is designed for dealing punishing attacks, while retaining the survivability and speed of the original Atlas. Engineers used 19.5 ton of Standard Armor fitted to an Endo Steel skeleton, and for the MechWarrior's protection the Atlas III employs an Armored Cockpit and a pair of Small Shields, with the latter split between both arms.",
    "deployment": "The D2 variant is intended for front line use instead of the rare D3's command role. This model retains the D3's Streak LRM-20, Streak SRM-6, and two of the Medium X-Pulse Lasers found in the left arm. The D2 drops the Rotary Autocannon for a more powerful Clan Class 30 Hyper-Assault Gauss Rifle. To make room for the mammoth weapon, both Small Shields are dropped. Its four tons of ammunition and the missile launchers' ammunition continue to be protected by the CASE II found in both side torsos. A Targeting Computer is fitted to the D2 to enhance targeting of enemy units.",
    "history": "The AS7-D versions of this generation of the Atlas was constructed with a mixture of Advanced Clan and Inner Sphere technologies. When it was first produced, the D3 was rare among the ranks of the AFFS and its ally, the Republic of the Sphere, where it was used by Battalion and Regimental leaders as a Command 'Mech. It is unclear if the D3 model of the 'Mech remained in production after the Draconis Combine's capture of Robinson in 3144."
