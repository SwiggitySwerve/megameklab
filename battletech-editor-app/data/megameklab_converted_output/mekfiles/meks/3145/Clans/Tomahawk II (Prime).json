    "overview": "The Tomahawk II is an Assault OmniMech first produced by Clan Wolf in 3088. The âMech is considered to be, for its time, the superior 'Mech when compared to other contemporaries within the ranks of the Inner Sphere and Inner Sphere Clans.",
    "capabilities": "The Tomahawk II is designed around the use of a DSAM Endo 10-Composite internal structure, which gives the design its cavernous pod capacity of 56 tons. The 'Mech is powered by a 300-Rated Starfire Extra-Light Fusion Engine, giving it a maximum speed of 54 kph. Protecting the engine and the Tomahawk II's other vitals is 19 tons of Advanced/3 standard armor, providing nearly maximum protection against enemy fire.",
    "deployment": "The 'Mech's Primary Configuration is fitted with a pair of Class 30 Hyper-Assault Gauss Rifles, one mounted in each of the arm actuators. Protected by CASE II, both weapons have a combined eight tons of ammunition split between them, giving each weapon 16 rounds of fire. Backing up the main guns are three long-reaching Extended-Range Large Lasers, with one found in each of the Tomahawk II's arms and one in the head. A pair of Medium Pulse Lasers rounds out the 'Mech's weaponry, giving it additional firepower at close-in ranges. Five additional Double Heat Sinks are fitted in the Omni Pod bays to help the 'Mech cope with the weapons' great heat buildup.",
    "history": "The Tomahawk II was based on early prototypes developed during the Clan Invasion era, which were produced in limited numbers. The Tomahawk II was originally produced at the Wolves' W-7 Facilities on Weingarten until the late 3130s when the Clan undertook its migration to then exFree Worlds League space. Production of the 'Mech would resume on Keystone at Earthwerks-FWL, Incorporated. One of the Tomahawk II's most notable uses was during Clan Wolf's invasion of Tharkad in 3143. Beta Galaxy's Galaxy Commander Alaric Ward utilized a binary of Tomahawk IIs in order to demoralize Tharkard's Lyran defenders. He deployed this elite Binary of Tomahawk IIs to defeat elements of the 2nd Royals at Nagelring in July."
